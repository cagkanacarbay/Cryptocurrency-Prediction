# Cryptocurrency-Prediction

This is a project I've been working on for the past few months with the aim of learning how to work with time series data. It aims to build a machine learning model to predict the direction of change of prices. 
This is first and foremost a project with a learning focus; some of the code(especially the earlier scripts) may be poorly written. 
I hope to add to this over time, with the focus shifting from learning to code to building a viable model that predicts price changes.
